## GREAT BUCC

Sometimes things don’t work out as planned or as expected, but let’s try and remember that God is God and he is with us at all times. 

We’ve compiled a playlist of songs that has helped us to remember that during times where it was easy to forget. We hope these songs will uplift you the way we felt while listening.
It can likewise be a playlist to aid in code and chill.

We encourage everyone to remain indoors and keep safe! Thank you, and we look forward to serving you once again
